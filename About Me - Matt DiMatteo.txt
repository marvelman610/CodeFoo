I am a graduate of Full Sail University with a Bachelor of Science in Game Development. I have been programming for over 3 years using Object Oriented Programming. I am proficient in XML, C++ and C#. I have programmed games as an individual and in teams of up to 16 people. College was a vigorous process where every month we would learn two new subjects covering area from basic coding skills to how computers work to rending 3D environments. This fast paced learning allowed me to graduated in just 2 years.
